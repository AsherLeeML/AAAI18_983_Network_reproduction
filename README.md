**Working on better code.**

This paper surprised my supervisor and me myself for its extremely high accuracy recognizing EEG signals. I managed to find the author's git repository but found some critical problems, which may make the results in the paper meaningless.

Instead of the traditional training, validating and testing pipeline, where we should consider the session-to-session and the subject-to-subject transfer and the way important BCI competitions and public datasets like the BBCI competitions took to strictly examine whether the algorithms being used are truly effective, the authors just shuffle all the 109 subjects' data and split them into training set and testing set with a 3:1 proportion. That's how the 98.3% accuracy was produced.

To save disk room I removed the raw data and useless code.
You can run the experiment yourself to see the results.
